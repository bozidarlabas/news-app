# News App
This application is developed, incorporating essential components such as:

**Dependency Injection** ([get-it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it)): The application employs dependency injection to promote a loosely coupled and easily maintainable codebase. By injecting dependencies, it facilitates the management and testing of components in isolation.

**API Services** ([retrofit](https://pub.dev/packages/retrofit)): The app integrates API services to communicate with remote servers, enabling data retrieval and interaction with external resources.

**Local Database** ([floor](https://pub.dev/packages/floor)): A local database is utilized to store and manage data locally, ensuring offline capabilities and efficient data handling.

**State Management** ([flutter-bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc)): The application incorporates an effective state management approach to handle the app's data flow and ensure consistent user interface updates.

**Hooks** ([flutter-hooks](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hooks)): Hooks, as a crucial feature, provide a streamlined way to reuse stateful logic and improve code readability.

**Router** ([auto-route](https://pub.dev/packages/auto_route)): The app includes a router, enabling navigation and smooth transitions between different screens or views.

**Lint** ([lint](https://pub.dev/packages/lint)): Code linting is employed to enforce consistent coding standards and identify potential errors or issues early in the development process, enhancing code quality.

By adopting these industry best practices and architectural patterns, the application achieves modularity, maintainability, and scalability, resulting in a robust and professional software solution.
